    <p>
      Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, 
      <br> they are unnecessary,
      <br> they are ugly,
      <br> they spoil the line of the writing
      <br> or the printing and anyway what is the use, 
      <br>if you do not know that a question is a question 
      <br>what is the use of its being a question.
      
      <br>  <br>
      <br>  <br>
      The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.
