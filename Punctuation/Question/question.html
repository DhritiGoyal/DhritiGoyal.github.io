        There are some punctuations that are
        <br> interesting
        <br> and there are some punctuations that are not.
        <br> Let us begin with the punctuations that are not.
        <br>
         Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the 
         <br>question mark.
         <br> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is 
         <br>completely
         <br> entirely 
         <br>completely 
         <br>uninteresting.
         <br> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when 
         <br>a question is a question
         <br> as it is written in writing. 
         <br> Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases 
         <br>neither the eye nor the ear
         <br> and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so 
         <br>why add to it the question mark when it is already there 
         <br>when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it 
         <br>positively revolting, and now very few do use it
