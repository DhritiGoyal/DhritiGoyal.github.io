        It is impossible to say how the idea first entered my head. There
        was no reason for what I did. I did not hate the old man; I even loved
        him. He had never hurt me. I did not want his money. I think it was
        his eye. His eye was like the eye of a vulture, the eye of one of those
        terrible birds that watch and wait while an animal dies, and then fall
        upon the dead body and pull it to pieces to eat it. When the old man
        looked at me with his vulture eye a cold feeling went up and down my back; even my blood became cold. And so, I finally decided I had to
        kill the old man and close that eye forever!
