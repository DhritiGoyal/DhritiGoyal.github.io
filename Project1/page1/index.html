    <h1> Its true! Yes I've been ill, very ill.
        <br>
        But why do you say that I lost control of my mind, why do u say that I'm mad?
     <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/iwasinthehouse/the-vulture-eye/">  mind?</a>
       <br>
       Can you not see that 
       <br>
       I have fullcontrolofmymind?
       <br>
       <br>
       Is it not clear that I am not mad?
       <br>
       Indeed, the illness only made my mind, my feelings, my senses stronger, more powerful.
       <br>
       My sense of hearing especially became more powerful. I could hear sounds I had
       <br>
       never heard before.
       <br>
       I heard sounds from heaven; and I heard sounds from hell!
       <br>

       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Listen! Listen, I will tell you how it happened. You will see, you will hear how healthy my mind is.
