 	Hi I'm Dhriti. I am a sophomore at Parsons School of Design. I am looking forward to learn how to code and understand how the internet is designed. 
<br>
<br>
I'm currently in India. 
<br>
<br>
I love sushi and thai curry. 
<br>
<br>
Before I switched my major to communication design, I was going to study Fine Arts. 
<br>
<br>
 A site I visit often is: canvas to check ALL the work I have for college:)
 <br>
 <br>
 The first site I remeber using is: MS paint in Windows
 <br>

 One of my favorite wikipedia pages: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife">Afterlife</a></p>
