        <h1>
                hi world
        </h1>
        <h2>
                technology is weird. its hard. but super interesting 
        </h2>
        <h3>
                the information in this html file will be hidden. so if you are reading this, you probably inspected the page.

        <h4>
                so come lets explore some questions about the seminal theory and computation!
        </h4>
                <p>
                    today gen z has been bought up with technology all aroun them. 
                    So interacting with it seems natural. 
                    however some one actually took the time to write these programs and build softwares 
                    in a webpage each element is coded and can be designed

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    people used these code to build sites and apps like instagram, facebook, google etc 
                    photos, information can be posted on these apps and products can be sold
                </p>

        <h2>
            how did these platforms come into being?
            how did they being popular?
            how was a visual space formed through these platformed?
        </h2>
                <p>
                    to explore these questions it is important to consider the software of these apps and sites.
                    as the readings mentioned, the software is "even more important than the output itself"
                </p>

                <p>
                    in these apps and websites, there are buttons u can click, lists you can scroll through 
                    and navigate in many more ways!
                </p>
                <p>
                    "the behind the scenes work makes this form of media compelling"
                </p>
    
        <h3>
            now you are viewing this information through a video. in which theres a website. inside the website there is this information. 

        </h3>
                <p>
                    this proves that "media doesnt influence our thought, but they are our thought". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    i am writing this program right now and it is my thought.
                </p>

        <h4>
            how will this information spread?
        </h4>
                <p>
                    this video will be shared with other people on these digital platforms.
                </p>

    <h5>
        lastly, its true what they say, "We become the media that produces things for these machines to operate on!!"
    </h5>
